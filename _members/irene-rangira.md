Irene Rangira is a PhD student from Rwanda. He holds a BSc in Food Science and Technology and an MSc in Food Science. His current research focuses on the quality evaluation of high-moisture meat analogues using a low-intensity ultrasound-based technique. Irene believes that ultrasound can significantly benefit the food industry by serving as a tool to non-destructively assess the mechanical properties of plant-based meat analogues during extrusion. The use of ultrasound can help ensure end-product consistency, prevent material loss, and reduce downtime in the food industry.
