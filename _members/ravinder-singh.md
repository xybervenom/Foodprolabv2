Ravinder Singh is a PhD student from India, holding an MSc in Food Sciences from the University of Manitoba and a B.Tech. in Food Technology from Punjab Agricultural University, Punjab, India. His doctoral research focuses on enhancing the flavor and nutritional profile of high-moisture meat analogues made from Indigenous wild rice and faba bean protein through fermentation and enzymatic techniques. Ravinder's work aims to address key flavor challenges in plant-based meats, making these alternatives more appealing and nutritious. Additionally, he seeks to answer fundamental questions related to the structure-function-digestion relationships of extruded food proteins in the high-moisture extrusion cooking process.
