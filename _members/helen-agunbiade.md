Helen is a masterâ€™s student from Nigeria. She holds a Bachelor of Technology degree in Food Science and Technology from The Federal University of Technology, Akure, Nigeria. Her current research is focused on improving the health benefits and the sensory quality of meat alternatives using pea, hemp, and lupin protein hydrolysates. She believes her research will add value to these important Manitoba crops to emerge as novel ingredients for the plant-based meat alternatives industry for enhanced health benefits and physical quality.
