Dr. Filiz Koksel is a food scientist specializing in food processing and non-destructive assessments of food quality. She holds Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Food Engineering from the Middle East Technical University in Ankara, Turkiye. Dr. Koksel earned her PhD in Food Science from the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada. Her doctoral research focused on utilizing low-intensity ultrasonics and synchrotron radiation to evaluate the mechanical properties and microstructure of bread dough, respectively.

Following her PhD, Dr. Koksel embarked on a one-year postdoctoral position jointly with the Universities of Manitoba and Saskatchewan in Canada, where she studied the effects of sodium reduction on the mechanical properties of baked goods. Subsequently, she undertook another postdoctoral position at the University of Manitoba, concentrating on the interactions between environment, genotype, and management practices on the breadmaking quality of Canada Western Red Spring (CWRS) wheat.

In 2018, she joined the Food and Human Nutritional Sciences Department of the University of Manitoba as an Assistant Professor. Currently she is an Associate Professor, teaching courses including but not limited to Food Processing and Food Engineering. Her current research program is dedicated to addressing the challenges associated with the growing demand for sustainable, high-quality plant-based foods, bridging the gap between food processing and materials science. Dr. Koksel's work encompasses various unit processes involved in the transformation of a wide range of crops into palatable foods with enhanced nutritional value, including milling, mixing, baking, texturization, and extrusion.
