  <strong> Ready-to-eat (RTE) breakfast cereals and puffed snacks </strong>
</div>


{% capture text %}

This research stream is focused on improving ready-to-eat (RTE) breakfast cereals and puffed snacks, aiming to make them healthier, more sustainable, and of higher quality. We are working to increase the fiber and protein content of these snacks, turning them into nutritious options that still taste great. To achieve this, we are exploring innovative processing techniques (e.g., gas-assisted extrusion cooking) that not only enhance nutritional value but also improve texture, a key aspect linked to the microstructure of the final product. <br>
In our lab, we employ high-speed thermal imaging and X-ray imaging techniques to gain deeper insights into the expansion process during production and to analyze the structure of the products post-production. The high-speed thermal imaging enables visualizing how the food products puff and change on the surface, so that we can refine the production process to create food products that are both appealing and nutritious. The X-ray imaging techniques allow us to see and quantify the microstructural characteristics of the food products in detail and in 3D, which is crucial for optimizing texture and overall quality. <br>
Sustainability is also at the core of our research. We are committed to developing RTE breakfast cereals and puffed snacks in a way that is environmentally friendly, ensuring that the production process focuses largely on plant-based food ingredients. In addition, we attempt to incorporate various by-products, food wastes, and underutilized ingredients into our formulations. This approach not only reduces environmental impact but also supports a more sustainable food system. Our overarching goal is to create RTE breakfast cereals and puffed snacks that are not only delicious and nutritionally balanced but also produced with sustainability in mind, benefiting both consumers and the planet. <br>

  <strong> Processing of Plant-Based Meat Alternatives  </strong>
</div>

{% capture text %}

We are working on creating plant-based meat alternatives that come as close as possible to the taste and texture of real meat. We use plant proteins from sources like cereals, pulses and oilseed meals transforming them through extrusion processing into fibrous, meat-like textures. These products work well as substitutes for various meat-based foods, including burgers, sausages, chicken breasts, and pork chops. <br>
We focus on four critical challenges in this field: taste, texture, nutrition, and sustainability. To enhance taste and texture, we are exploring pre-treatment methods like fermentation and enzymatic treatments before extrusion processing. These techniques help eliminate beany odors, reduce bitterness, and introduce umami-rich, meat-like flavors. We are also refining the production process by optimizing the extrusion processing parameters and using innovative systems like gas injection. On the nutrition side, we are focused on enhancing protein quality, increasing dietary fiber, and incorporating health-promoting bioactive components.<br>
Sustainability is a core value in our research, and we are committed to incorporating by-products from the food industry, such as sunflower meal, hempseed meal, flaxseed meal, spent grain, and spent yeast, into our formulations. We also collaborate with Indigenous-owned food companies to integrate underutilized and culturally important ingredients like Indigenous wild rice.<br>
Throughout the entire process, i.e., from raw materials and pre-treatments to extrusion and the finished product, we use various testing methods to study macro and micro-level changes. These tests include rheological analysis, assessments of techno-functional, nutritional, and textural quality, microstructural evaluation, and cooking properties. These tests help us gain deeper scientific insights and improve the quality of these products.
Our goal is to create plant-based meat alternatives that are delicious, nutritious, and sustainable, benefiting both consumers and the environment.

  <strong> Dry fractionation for production of novel ingredients  </strong>
</div>
{% capture text %}

Our lab is dedicated to advancing the development of novel plant-based ingredients through cutting-edge dry fractionation techniques, including sifting and air classification. By focusing on underutilized plant protein sources, such as cereal grains like barley, we aim to unlock the potential of these ingredients for various applications in food production. Leveraging pilot-scale dry fractionation facilities, we not only develop innovative protein ingredients but also extract functional components that provide added nutritional benefits.
<br>
For example, through our work with barley, we isolate high-quality protein fractions while concentrating beneficial dietary fibers, such as Î²-glucans. These fibers are known for their role in promoting gut health and lowering cholesterol levels, making them highly valuable in the formulation of health-conscious food products. Our approach to dry fractionation is sustainable, as it avoids the use of water or harsh chemicals, which helps preserve the natural functionality of the ingredients.
<br>
This research opens up new possibilities for creating plant-based ingredients with specific functional and nutritional properties, catering to the growing demand for healthier, more sustainable food products. Through collaborations with industry and academia, we continue to push the boundaries of plant-based ingredient development, ensuring that our research has real-world applications in both food processing and nutrition.
